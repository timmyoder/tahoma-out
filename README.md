# Tahoma Tracker - Is She out?

A website that tells you if Tahoma (aka Mt. Rainier) is out. If 'She out', the mountain is visible from downtown Seattle. 

The website uses the King 5 [waterfront webcam](https://www.king5.com/webcams). I trained an image classifier on a few months of pictures from the webcam to tell if she out or not.
